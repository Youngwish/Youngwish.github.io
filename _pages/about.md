I am currently a professor and doctoral supervisor at South China Normal University and used to be a visiting scholar at Monash University in Australia. I am interested in higher education, comparative education, history of education, and educational psychology, especially focusing on the academic genealogy of education in China and the differences in the higher education system between China and Western countries. I am also devoted to graduate employability, personality, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and occupational health psychology, especially for vulnerable populations, using quantitative and qualitative research methods. He has published a wide range of high-quality works and built high visibility in the international academic society. I am seeking an in-depth collaboration with those who desire to continuously contribute to the research on the internationalization of higher education and occupational behavior.
